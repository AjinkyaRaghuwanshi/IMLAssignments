This is a program that will detect the Lanes on the road, one basic part of autonomous vehicle.
Using computer vision techniques in Python, we will identify road lane lines in which autonomous
cars must run. This will be a critical part of autonomous cars, as the self-driving cars should
not cross itâ€™s lane and should not go in opposite lane to avoid accidents.
